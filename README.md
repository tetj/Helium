# Helium With Tabs
This is a fork of [Helium](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Helium), it's a theme inspired by Steam and Plex.
This theme is for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/tetj/HeliumWithTabs/releases/)
2. Open the .pthm file

## Usage & features
Download instructions [here](https://github.com/tetj/BonusTools/raw/refs/heads/master/documentation/Playnite.docx)

## Work in progress
1. I need to change the text "number of reviews" for "user score" depending on the user preference (number of reviews requires the BonusTools extension)
2. I need to translate a few labels
3. Bug : Background image no longer visible when video is hidden for some reasons
